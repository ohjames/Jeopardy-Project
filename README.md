# Jeopardy-Project
data manipulation

This project tested my skills with fixing up data frames to make them look neater such as fixing mis-formatted column names and changing values of a column into a different datatype.
I created a few functions to filter the Jeopardy dataset by filtering a word out of a sentence/question. I also removed hyperlinks from some of the sentences/questions.

#todo remove hyperlink, but retain the string following it
